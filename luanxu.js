For one thing, even if students punch the wall heavily, the true stress in the bottom of their hearts can not be let out. Foranother, this may lead to the results of solving a problem with violence of fixing a bad temper, which has bad effects on their health growth.</p><p>In order to decrease our stress, here are my suggestions. To begin with, we can design more outdoor activities for students to get rid of the stress. What’s more, it is strongly suggested that we can take part in some sports events, which can surely help students out of stress and improve their health at the same time. All in all, only when we let out the stress properly can we live a happy school life.</p>"
